# FizzBuzz
Answer to the fizz buzz question aparently asked at programming interviews

Not very exciting - loops from 1 to 100 and checks if each number is divisible first by 3, then by 5 and outputs acordingly.

The result is a print of 1-100 with /3 numbers replaced by Fizz, /5 numbers replaced by Buzz, and numbers divisible by both replaced with FizzBuzz:

eg, 
1
2
fizz
4
Buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
Buzz
11
fizz
13
14
